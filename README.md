# Data-Transformation-and-Update
This project involves transforming and updating data from a CSV file, applying transformations to certain columns, and then appending the transformed data into a Delta table in a Databricks environment.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- PySpark
- Delta Lake

# Configure Spark and Delta Lake
Ensure that you have a Spark and Delta Lake setup in your environment. This typically involves configuring Spark with Delta Lake libraries.
